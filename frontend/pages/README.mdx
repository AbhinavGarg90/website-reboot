# README.md

Documentation for Open-Source at Illinois

## Who we are

OSAI is a community of people passionate about transparent technology. We're a low time-commitment, no-stress organization on a mission to spread the open-source philosophy at UIUC.

Through events, workshops and socials, we're commited to creating value through technical, social and professional development opportunities.

### Staying Updated

**Mailing List:** Stay updated via email by filling out [this interest form](http://eepurl.com/h-hO_j)

**Website:** All up-to-date event information can be found on the [calendar page](/calendar)

**Discord** Watch the #announcement channel on Discord for latest information. We'll also share polls, highlights and other news here.

**Core API** Our [core API](https://api.opensourceatillinois.com/events) powers our discord bot and website, and is free for you to integrate with any other applications.

### Verification

Run `/netid <your_netid>` on Discord to verify your affiliation with the University of Illinois.

### Attendance

Run `/attend <code>` to mark your attendance. The `<code>` is given out in the middle of the meeting, and will automatically award you points for attendance.

### Point System

This Fall, we're piloting a new point system to recognize and appreciate our members' efforts towards the club.

- You can see how many points a meeting is worth by running /events on discord, or on the [calendar page](/calendar)

- See how many points you have by running `/points` on Discord

- In general, normal meetings are worth 10 points; Socials, workshops and other events are worth 15-30 points.

- You can also earn points by verifying your netID on discord (5 points) and visiting our Quad Day booth (5 points).

- Crossing a 40 point threshold makes you an "active" member and enables you to run for leadership positions at Open-Source at Illinois

### Github

Our projects and other software assets (including this website) are hosted on Github.

Access to join the Github organization is given to contributors of Open-Source at Illinois projects.
