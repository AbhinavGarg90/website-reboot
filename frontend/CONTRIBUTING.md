# Contributing

So, you want to get into contributing to the club's website? Great! Let's just go over a couple of things that'll help you and fellow contributors:

* When making commits, try to name them something short and descriptive -- see [here](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/) if you want specifics, but just make sure commits aren't like [this](https://xkcd.com/1296/).

* You can force push to branches on your own repo from which you make PRs, but don't force push to your own master -- keeping your master as up-to-date with the organization master is good practice, and saves us all headaches. To those of you with direct write permission to the repository, please do NOT force push to the organization branches.

* You can name your branch something that's related to what you're going to be doing on that branch. Not mandated, but if it's a branch dedicated to an issue, feel free to use the convention `i<issue-number>-<subject-of-fix>`. For example, `i14-contributing-guidelines`. 

* Open PRs to the development branch. This is because the website is automatically published on the master branch, and so we want to make sure all changes are safe before merging into master.
