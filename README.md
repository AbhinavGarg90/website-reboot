# Open-Source @ Illinois Website (2020-2021)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

cPanel only has Node version 10.22 and only has `npm`, so it is recommended that you use `npm` instead of `yarn`.

### To Start:

1.) Run `npm install` in the root of the repo.
2.) To test the frontend, run `cd frontend && npm run build && npm run dev`.
3.) To test the backend, run `cd backend && npm run dev`.
